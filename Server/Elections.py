# An Election
On all elections there are at least two options:
1. Proposal 1
2. None of the Other options
There can be more Proposals, but if None of the other Options
wins, nothing happens.
Each Election has this field filled:
- deadline, unix timestamp of the end of voting

All Proposals in an Election can either be:
1. Human Readable
2. Executable

A Human Readable Proposal is:
{ "removals" : [<law hashes>]
, "new" : [{ "title" : <title>, "paragraphs" : [<ยง1>,<ยง2>,...] }]
, "ammendments" : [{ "law" : <hash of existing law>, "paragraphs" : [<ยง1 ammended>, <ยง2 ammended> ...] }]
, "description" : <markdown description of the Proposal in simple terms>
}
Removals are all the Human Readable Laws, that  should be
removed by the Proposal.
"new" Laws are totally new Laws, that should apply
if the Proposal is approved.
Ammendments are Paragraphs, that are added to an existing law at the end.

An Executable Proposal is
a reference to a path of the Git Repo relative to $PATCHES/
If a proposal is created for a Patch, then the Git Repo cannot
be modified. (chmod a-w <path/to/repo>)
Thus a Proposal would look like this:
{ path : <$PATCHES/path/to/repo>
, description : <brief and simple description of the Proposal>
}
